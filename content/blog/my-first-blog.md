Hello, World! :earth_africa:

Finally, it's time to make a website and blog. Let's see where this goes. It's mostly work-related stuff that interests me.

The left-hand-side profile picture was actually quite pixelated. But an online ai [tool](https://picsart.com/photo-editing-tools/) applied Photoshop *interpolation* (made up the finer pixel data that was not available!), added an art effect, and removed some background. Good enough for this purpose.

But such interpolation is **not** recommended when working with missing data for statistical inference or machine learning, however. It wrecs havoc with the validity and certainty of the estimates. Instead you would want to implement a much more advanced method--[multiple imputation--which is actually not well-supported in python](https://github.com/joh4nd/amelia-rpy2).
