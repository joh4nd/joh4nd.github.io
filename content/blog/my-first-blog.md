Hello, World! :earth_africa:

Finally, it's time to make a website and blog. Let's see where this goes. It's mostly work-related stuff that interests me.

The left-hand-side profile picture was actually quite pixelated. But an online ai [tool](https://picsart.com/photo-editing-tools/) applied Photoshop *interpolation* ("made up" the finer pixels that were missing), added an art effect as online obfuscation, and removed some background. Good enough.

However, such interpolation would wrec havoc with the validity and certainty of the estimates from statistical inference or machine learning - **not** recommended! Instead you would want to implement a much more advanced method--multiple imputation--which is actually not well-supported in python. That's why I made a tiny recipe for running [Amelia through Python with rpy2](https://github.com/joh4nd/amelia-rpy2).
