Horrified by the invasion of Ukraine I came across daily war-fire insights by Solstad@theEconomist nicely summarized in this GIF. The perhaps the best polsci's of all time have tried to infer individual behavior from geographical, ecological data, and I dare say without overwhelming success. The powerful predictors tend rather to be below the individual levels than above this level (wink: a reason to be interested in political psychology). But in the case of the war-fire model, geospatial data from satelite imagery clearly tracks the war better than individual behavior may do. Deaths and the horror of fire are obviously individual level pieces of information, but material destruction and fire itself aren't.
