- Interest and domain knowledge.
- Statistical analysis of data.
- Instructing computers to process data.

These competencies are useful in tandem. And though their relative importance may shift, I believe the direction or extent of this could be clearer.

10 years ago, Gary King explained that ["Big data" is actually not about the data](https://gking.harvard.edu/publications/preface-big-data-not-about-data). Big data is about what you do with it. It's about the analytics; making the data actionable.

In a time where chat-gpt emerged and where many people are aware of ai/ml and data science, Gary's point is provocative. People may believe that one should hold a data science degree to handle information technologies like programming, data analysis, predictive modelling. Considering the vast body of freely available materials for learning IT this is obviously mistaken. Yet, on the surface, Gary seems to weigh statistics and substantive knowledge higher than data or computer science. This corresponds to telling political scientists like me that we are all set and clear. Obviously, it is not that simple (I'll return to this point near the end of the post).But let's stick to his point.

At least Gary's point provoked me while being so obviously true: Of course what matters is the quality of the decision that can be made based on the data. But that also means that the data is an underlying confounder. In other words, if not the data is correct then forget about statistical inference. I've experienced that the data is in fact far more important than advanced statistical inference techniques and software. From that perspective the point *is* indeed the data (and some programming). Knowledge about statistical computations and reasoning about the domain has enabled me to understand when data is problematic and that it needed 'engineering' or wrangling to better inform business decisions.

In my opinion, the social sciences should invite students to learn these parts of computer science. Social science concepts are complex, which implies the data can be quite informative if gotten right. For instance, an introduction to the ways data can be processed and the infrastructure that enables this processing. Not least, with the post-millenium changes manifested in the Apache stack under the names of [Hadoop and Spark](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-analytics-with/9780134844855/) (the setup that Gary says is expensive) that I am currently reading about. Growing up with IT like www/networking, programming, and data processing at home, should I have assumed that those toys were for CS degress only?! I don't think my opinion should be surprising because my way of thinking is not new at all. Consider the facts below:

- The teacher of the famous [CS50](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcabW7890RKJzL968QWEykA) course, [David Malan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Malan), started out as undergraduate in political science or what is called Government at Harvard.
- In the 1960s, the java-based software named [Statistical Package for the Social Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS) was developed by political scientist [Norman Nie](https://news.stanford.edu/2015/05/08/norman-nie-obit-050815/) and a few of his CS friends.
- And, yes, Gary King himself is a great example.

Let's pick up the last bullet point. Look at what he has done to better enable data to be shared in science. "Big" deal! He has also contributed to much statistical software and how to prepare data for analysis. He obviously jumps to the more (way more!) advanced inferential problems because he champions it all. And he flags the economic calculous that tends to support statistical inference: drawing data samples rather than for the whole population.

Fortunately, many smart people out there are also aware of the need to reconsolidate their disciplines based on the overlap addressed here. We see new programmes like "social data science" and "computational social science" shoot up next to the old ones. Hopefully the awkward silos will be torn down such that Python is no longer for IT and AI/ML folks (data science and computer science) while R is for applied statistics type domain fields (political science, economy, sociology, psychology, biology, genomics, etc.).

As long as domain fields (like politics, sociology, psychology, business, economics), computer science, and statistics have existed, individuals have naturally acquired competencies that span all three fields. They are more useful together than apart, and domain interest likely drives attempts to understand whether data, software, or the statistical method is problematic and needs a fix.
