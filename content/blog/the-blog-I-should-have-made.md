Horrified by the invasion of Ukraine I came across daily war-fire insights by Solstad@theEconomist. The perhaps the best polsci's of all time have tried to [infer individual behavior from geographical, ecological data](https://gking.harvard.edu/category/research-interests/methods/ecological-inference), and I dare say without overwhelming success. The powerful predictors are rather below than above the individual level (hence my interest in political psychology). But in the case of the war-fire model, geospatial data from satelite imagery clearly measures the war better than individual behavior may do.
