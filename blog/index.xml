Finally, it&amp;rsquo;s time to make a website and blog. Let&amp;rsquo;s see where this goes. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly work-related stuff that interests me.
The left-hand-side profile picture was actually quite pixelated. But an online ai tool applied Photoshop interpolation (made up the finer pixel data that was not available!), added an art effect, and removed some background. Good enough for this purpose.
But such interpolation is not recommended when working with missing data for statistical inference or machine learning, however.</description></item><item><title>war-fire insight (A Blog Post I Could Have Made)</title><link>https://joh4nd.github.io/blog/the-blog-i-should-have-made/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joh4nd.github.io/blog/the-blog-i-should-have-made/</guid><description>Horrified by the invasion of Ukraine I came across daily war-fire insights by Solstad@theEconomist. The perhaps the best polsci&amp;rsquo;s of all time have tried to infer individual behavior from geographical, ecological data, and I dare say without overwhelming success. The powerful predictors are rather below than above the individual level (hence my interest in political psychology). But in the case of the war-fire model, geospatial data from satelite imagery clearly measures the war better than individual behavior may do.</description></item></channel></rss>
